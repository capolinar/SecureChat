"# SecureChat" 
Client.py and Server.py are normal and work as intended

Client 2 and 3 are for demo purposes.

Client 2 has the decryption taken out to showcase messages being sent/recieved in ciphertext for security.

Client 3 has the wrong AES symmetric key, so the functions do no work correctly.
